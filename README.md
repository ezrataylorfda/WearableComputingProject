# WearableComputingProject

This repository contains my script, code book, and output file for the Week 4 project for "Getting and Cleaning Data". 

This data is based on the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0.

The script does the following:
- Extracts raw data from the source .txt files
- Binds the raw data tables into a consolidated data frame
- Adds column labels to each data column
- Filters out the mean and standard deviation functions
- Melts the data columns into a single variable column
- Extracts the variables from the variable column into separate columns, with one variable per column
- Assigns clear and understandable column titles to each column
- Calculates the average for each distinct combination of variables
- Outputs a tidy dataset into a .csv and .txt file

More information about how the script works is included as comments in the script file.

This script analyzes the raw data files and outputs a dataset that conforms to tidy data principles.
The code book explains the inputs and outputs of the script.
The tidy output file is in a .csv format. The scipt also outputs a .txt file.

# WearableComputingProject

This repository contains my script, code book, and output file for the Week 4 project for "Getting and Cleaning Data". 

This data is based on the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0.

The script analyzes the raw data files and outputs a dataset that conforms to tidy data principles
The code book explains the inputs and outputs of the script.
The tidy output file is in a .csv format.
